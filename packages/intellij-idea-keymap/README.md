# Introduction

As a power IntelliJ IDEA user I am used to the key bindings for years and therefore I created this package to be able to use the same bindings in the Atom editor too. I hope you can also make use of it and contributions/feedbacks are welcome.

# Features

The `intellij-idea-keymap` package has the following features:

* Basic key bindings of IntelliJ IDEA are mapped to core commands in Atom for Mac OSX, Windows and Linux
* If you want to format the code automatically you can install the [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) package and then use the `cmd-alt-l` shortcut to format code in the active editor.

# Installation

To install the package please execute the following command in a terminal:

```shell
apm install intellij-idea-keymap
```

If the `apm` command is not recognized then please open Atom, open the `Atom` menu, and select `Install Shell Commands`. Then try it again.

# Changelog

Please have a look at the changelog [here](https://github.com/guylabs/intellij-idea-keymap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Contribution

If you want to add more shortcuts or any other feature please create a pull request and I will try my best to review and merge it. Contributing is highly appreciated! Thanks in advance.
